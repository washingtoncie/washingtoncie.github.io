### The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)’s mission is to connect Washington, D.C.’s distinctive international community to the local community.

**WCIE organizes education, community service, and student service learning programs.** We believe that at this unique moment we need to come together to address issues like the [global migration and refugee crisis](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis), [racism](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-racism), and [conservation and the environment](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-freshwater-crisis).

The Washington, D.C. area offers us unique resources. Building on these resources, we [explore diplomacy](/exploring-diplomacy), [serve recently-resettled refugees](/community-service/refugee-resettlement), and bring people together through [community service](/community-service). Perhaps we will meet you during one of our twice-annual [Community Service Weeks](/community-service/community-service-weeks), and maybe you’ll get engaged in our programs more and more deeply over time.

We are grateful for the students and families that join our programs; the facilitators and administrative [team](/team) that bring our small group experiences to life; and to our many partners -- particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com/), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so we also thank the donors that support our programs and invite you to consider [supporting us](/support) as well.

We look forward to meeting you and thank you for your interest in WCIE!
