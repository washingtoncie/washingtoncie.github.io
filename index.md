### WCIE invites students to engage with each other and their world. Our purpose is active learning and service in community; and our programs are internationally-oriented and designed to inspire.

We all need to come together to address the world’s most pressing challenges. WCIE programs address tough topics like [racism](https://washingtoncie.org/community-service-and-ssl/youth-facing-racism/), the [global migration and refugee crisis](https://washingtoncie.org/community-service-and-ssl/youth-facing-the-global-migration-and-refugee-crisis/), and [conservation and the environment](https://washingtoncie.org/community-service-and-ssl/youth-facing-the-global-freshwater-crisis/). We take a holistic approach to intellectual, social, and emotional growth. We serve the student, and we hope to reach students’ families as well.

The Washington, D.C. area offers us unique learning resources. Building on these resources, we design [monthly programs](http://english-now.com/files/january2020activities.pdf) that offer eye-opening experiences and celebrate cross-cultural team building. And we delight in connecting the international community to local programs and experiences.

We are grateful for the students and families that join our programs; the facilitators and administrative team that bring our small group experiences to life; and to our many partners - particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com/), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and we also thank the donors that support our programs.

We look forward to meeting you and thank you for your interest in WCIE!
