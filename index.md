### The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)’s mission is to connect people and resources in Washington, D.C.’s distinctive international community, to the local community and to the needs of refugees.

WCIE organizes education, community service, and student service learning programs. We believe that at this unique moment we need to come together to address issues like the [global migration and refugee crisis](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis), [racism](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-racism), and [conservation and the environment](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-freshwater-crisis).

The Washington, D.C. area offers us unique resources. Building on these resources, we bring people together through [community service](/community-service), [serve recently-resettled refugees](/community-service/refugee-resettlement), and [explore diplomacy](/exploring-diplomacy). We love meeting people through one of our twice-annual [Community Service Weeks](/community-service/community-service-weeks), then we hope you’ll engage in our programs more and more deeply over time.

We are grateful for the volunteers, students, and families that join our programs; the facilitators and administrative [team](/team) that bring our small group experiences to life; and to our many partners – particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so we also thank the donors that [support our programs](/support) and invite you to consider supporting us as well.

We look forward to meeting you and thank you for your interest in WCIE!
