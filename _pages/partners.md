## Meet Our Partners
We are grateful to our partners, particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com/), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

Our collaborative projects have included community service projects with Sunrise Senior Living, [Bethesda Cares](https://bethesdacares.org/), and [The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health](https://childrensinn.org/) in Bethesda, Identity, Inc. and September House MAJ. WCIE and English Now! also partnered with [MCAEL Coalition for a Connected Community](https://mcael.org/) to recognize [Welcoming Week](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/programs/welcoming-week) in 2019 and 2020.

We are also happy to support the efforts of the [International Rescue Committee](https://rescue.org) to serve refugees being resettled in the Washington, D.C. area.

Please contact us if you’d like to join our efforts to connect the international and the local community. We look forward to meeting you!
