## Meet Our Partners
We are grateful to our partners particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com/), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

Our collaborative projects have included community service projects with Sunrise Senior Living, [Bethesda Cares](https://bethesdacares.org/), and [The Children's Inn](https://childrensinn.org/) in Bethesda, as well as special programs such as Understanding U.S. Schools, and Understanding U.S. Colleges and Universities. WCIE and English Now! also partnered with [MCAEL Coalition for a Connected Community](https://mcael.org/) to recognize [Welcoming Week](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/programs/welcoming-week) in 2019 and 2020.

We are also happy to support the efforts of the International [Rescue Committee](https://rescue.org) to serve refugees being resettled in the Washington, D.C. area.

Please contact us if youâ€™d like to join our efforts to connect the international and the local community. We look forward to meeting you!
