## Meet Our Partners

We are grateful to our partners, particularly [English Now!](http://english-now.com/), the Bethesda, Maryland-based language school whose community inspires ours, as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, and the Montgomery County Public Schools, which [certify our Student Service Learning programs](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/agency/detail/?agency_id=92808).

Our collaborative projects have included community service projects with Sunrise Senior Living, [Bethesda Cares](https://bethesdacares.org/), [The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health](https://childrensinn.org/), Identity, Inc., September House MAJ, and the Betty Ann Krahnke Center. WCIE and English Now! have also partnered with [MCAEL Coalition for a Connected Community](https://mcael.org/) to recognize [Welcoming Week](https://welcomingamerica.org/initiatives/welcoming-week/) each year since 2019.

We are also happy to support the efforts of the [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/) and [Homes Not Borders](https://www.homesnotborders.org/) to serve refugees being resettled in the Washington, D.C. area, and those of the [International Association for Women Judges](https://www.iawj.org/) to serve judges from its Afghanistan chapter who are now refugees in the U.S. and around the world.

Please [contact us](/contact) if you’d like to join our efforts to connect the international and the local community. We look forward to meeting you!
