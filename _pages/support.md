We thank you for your interest in the Washington Center for International Education. We look forward to meeting you and hope you can join our programs. We are often asked how people can support what we do. If you are interested not only in joining our programs but also in supporting our mission, we invite you to consider the following:

## Volunteer

Some of our activities and programs require volunteer support. Please let us know if you may be interested in supporting one of our programs (for students, parents, or educators), and we will be glad to update you about current and future events. (NOTE: All volunteers must provide references and complete a background check.)

## Program Support

We are always hoping to find support for programs that will extend our impact in the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond. The issues we address are of crucial importance to primary and secondary schools and higher education, as well as to the students and families we serve.

We invite you to consider supporting programs including our Student Service Learning programs, Community Service Weeks, and programs serving refugees being resettled in the area.

## Core Support

Finally, please contact us if you are inspired by our projects and what we might accomplish together with you or your organization. We’d love to talk to you about your vision for internationally-oriented education and service programs, and we’re open to deep collaboration with individuals and organizations.
