We thank you for your interest in the Washington Center for International Education. We look forward to meeting you and hope you can join our programs. We are often asked how people can support what we do. If you are interested not only in joining our programs but also in supporting our mission, we invite you to consider the following:

## Volunteer

Some of our activities and programs require volunteer support. Please let us know if you may be interested in supporting one of our programs (for students, parents, or educators), and we will be glad to update you about current and future events. (NOTE: Volunteers in some community service programs that involve direct engagement with youth require a background check, and those volunteers must also provide references.)

## Community Service Program Support

We invite you to consider supporting our Community Service Week activities. Our programs bring the international and local communities and connect people to the community. Support our first-ever GoFundMe, for our Spring 2022 Community Service Week! Click [here](https://gofund.me/57e80621){:target="_blank"}, learn more about how we're bringing people together, and help us do this and more!

## ESOL Scholarship Support

WCIE is sponsoring four English Now! group classes for refugees resettled in the area, and we would like to organize more to respond to considerable needs for English language on the part of Afghan evacuees as well as other IRC clients.

Recently-resettled refugees benefit from personal attention in English Now! classes that can make a tremendous difference in their transition to life in the U.S. Classes are small–six students maximum in-person or four students maximum online–and teachers are professional educators with significant experience.

[Contact us](/contact) for more information about partnering with us to support scholarships for recently-arrived refugees, and we would be happy to tell you about the profiles of our current class offerings and needs in the community.

## Core Support

Finally, please contact us if you are inspired by our projects and what we might accomplish together with you or your organization. We’d love to talk to you about your vision for internationally-oriented education and service programs, and we’re open to deep collaboration with individuals and organizations.
