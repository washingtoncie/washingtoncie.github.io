## International Walk & Talk Against Racism

Join us for a dialogue about racism against the inspiring backdrop of the Washington Mall.

Racism is an issue that has long gripped the country (and the world). It's a problem that we must acknowledge. And it's one that we must work to overcome, together.

We'll be a very international group - from all over the world and the U.S.; long-term residents and new arrivals to the area; young and old. We believe that our varied perspectives are a resource as we address these issues.

We will lament the history and present day of racism; and we will talk about how we can respond to racism as individuals, as families, and in our communities.
