## Household Goods & Furniture Drive

We collect items for donation to neighbors in need twice a year as part of our Community Service Weeks. Our Donation Drives started in Fall 2021, as we collected donations to furnish three apartments (see our flyer!). In Spring 2022, contributions were distributed through  [Homes Nor Borders](https://www.homesnotborders.org/), a great, local organization that works with partner organizations like ours to furnish apartments for newly-arrived refugee families.

The list of items below responded to Homes Not Borders’s needs to restock their warehouse in suburban Maryland as of Spring 2022. We look forward to another donation drive for Fall 2022. Watch here for information about the needs we’ll address together, partner organizations, and how to get involved! You’ll see that they don’t need everything – but we appreciate your donations of items that align with these specific needs.

### Donations of the following items would be appreciated:

**Small furniture items**: Small tables - coffee tables, end tables, bedside tables; and lamps - floor lamps & table lamps (please make sure they all take a common lightbulb).

**Household items**: Tea kettles (stovetop or electric); irons; food storage containers (VERY clean with no stains, or new); serving dishes (bowls and larger plates); glass baking dishes; household scissors; bath mats (very clean or new)

**School Supplies (prefer new if possible)**: 1.5” 3 ring binders, spiral notebooks, folders, colored pencils and pens, pencil cases, small pencil sharpener, boxed 24 crayons / washable markers / gel pens (new), scissors (normal and rounded tip), glue sticks, backpacks (in very clean / like-new condition)
