## Household Goods & Furniture Drive

Join our effort to support a local community initiative, “Scouting Against Global Hunger.”

Boy Scout Troop 233 of Bethesda is collecting food and household items  for local and international communities and is partnering with WCIE to service local immigrants and refugees.

This is an Eagle Scout Project led by Arun Acharya connecting three local and one international charity into a global network. We are helping refugees, homeless people and senior citizens, through food drives, clothing drives, and volunteer service.

WCIE is delighted to partner with Boy Scout Troop 233 to serve refugees, and to collect food and clothing and recruit volunteers for Scouting Against Global Hunger projects. Watch for more information here about how you can get involved this fall in this project, and please [email us](mailto:communityservice@washingtoncie.org) to let us know if you’d like to get involved.
