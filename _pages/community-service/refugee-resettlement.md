## Serve Refugees Resettled in the Washington, D.C. Area

Refugees are people whose lives have been upended by war, conflict and natural disasters. They are resettled around the world through a global effort coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

We are delighted to support the efforts of the International Rescue Committee, headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, to resettle refugees in the Washington, D.C. area. Students learn about issues related to refugee resettlement in our Student Service Learning Program, [Youth Facing the Global Refugee & Migration Crisis](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis); we highlight opportunities to serve locally-resettled refugees in our [Community Service Week](/community-service/community-service-weeks) programs; and our partner English Now! offers scholarships to locally-resettled refugees for English language study, to help them and their families thrive in their transitions to life in the United States.
