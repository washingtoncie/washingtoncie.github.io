Refugees are people whose lives have been upended by war, conflict and natural disasters. They are resettled around the world through a global effort coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in unusual circumstances such as the collapse of the government in Afghanistan in 2021 are evacuated then brought into the refugee resettlement system later.

**Think globally, serve locally.** Refugee resettlement is an issue that starts globally but requires communities to mobilize locally, to make resettlement work. This issue aligns with our mission and inspires many of our volunteers. Join us to help make refugee resettlement successful in the Washington, D.C. area.

### Community Learning

The Washington, D.C. area is a popular destination for many refugees because of the connection that some refugees have with the federal government, family ties, and a strong labor market generally. WCIE organizes community learning events to help like-minded people and organizations understand how to resettle refugees well, in this area.

We are organizing an event, “Welcoming Refugees from Afghanistan & Ukraine,” at the Connie Morella (Bethesda) Library on Monday, May 9. We are grateful to our speakers, Mikhail Basyuk, who will share a Ukrainian-Russian's perspective--a personal story of coming to the U.S.; and Sarwar Azizi, who served as a senior official in Afghanistan's Central Bank and Ministry of Education and previously with the United Nations, and who will speak about his family's experience as well as how we can understand the needs of Afghan evacuees settling in the area and around the country. We will also hear from a representative of the International Rescue Committee (IRC).

Please register for this public program [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/welcoming-refugees-from-afghanistan-ukraine-registration-313660927277){:target="_blank"} or [email us](mailto:communityservice@washingtoncie.org) for more information and to be put on a mailing list for information about future programs.

### Support for IRC Programs

Our efforts in this area start with partnerships. We are delighted to support the efforts of the [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/) (IRC), headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, to resettle refugees in the Washington, D.C. area. We organize groups that participate in the IRC’s [Welcome Home](https://www.rescue.org/volunteer/refugee-welcome-home-project-volunteer) program to furnish apartments for newly-arrived refugee families and also work with another local organization, [Homes Not Borders](https://www.homesnotborders.org/), to furnish apartments. See [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/englishnow/sets/72157720038146891/) for photos from a volunteer effort that furnished three apartments in October 2021. In addition, we encourage people to get involved in IRC family mentoring and other programs. Participate in one of [the IRC’s monthly webinars](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmJUvE_Pa7ZjZI5R6ATvLj9XnXKvRB6U889IdIMWyFjYN5kg/viewform) to learn more about their programs.

### ESOL Studies

WCIE also sponsors enrollments of recently-resettled refugees in our partner [English Now!](http://english-now.com/)’s English classes. English language studies are important to refugees’ transition to life in the U.S. English Now!’s group classes are small–six students maximum in-person, four students maximum online–and taught by experienced professionals, making them an unusually personalized way to care for refugees.

We are sponsoring four English Now! group classes for refugees resettled in the area, and we would like to organize more to respond to considerable needs for English language on the part of Afghan evacuees as well as other IRC clients. Please consider donating to support these classes–see [here](/support) for information about how to support this effort.

### Student Service Learning

Finally, we are inspired by our work with high school students, and we hope that students find inspiration in our programs as well. Youth learn about issues related to refugee resettlement in our Student Service Learning Program, [Youth Facing the Global Refugee & Migration Crisis](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis), which includes participation in a diplomacy simulation offered at the U.S. Department of State.
