## Household Goods & Food Drive

We collect items for donation to neighbors in need twice a year as part of our Community Service Weeks. Your donations in Fall 2021 were distributed through:

- the International Rescue Committee's [Welcome Home program](https://www.rescue.org/volunteer/refugee-welcome-home-project-volunteer) (we are organizing groups to furnish apartments for newly-arrived refugee families - learn more about this program and let us know if you'd like to join (or co-lead!) a group);
- Identity, Inc., a great, Rockville-based organization that creates opportunities for Latino and other historically underserved youth to realize their highest potential and thrive; and
- September House MAJ, a local organization that provides support for everyday life for Japanese people living in the Mid-Atlantic region.

See below for a list of household goods and furniture items that our donation drive focused on in Fall 2021. Our Community Service Week Steering Committee is setting priorities for Spring 2022.
