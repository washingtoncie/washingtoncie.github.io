## Join Our “Community Service Week” Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE),** will hold its Spring 2023 Community Service Week, to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community, April 29-May 6, 2023.

WCIE has organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2018. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area’s international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Community Service Week is a time to encourage us all to think globally and serve & engage locally, together!** Then activities continue year-round.

Our Fall 2022 Community Service Week featured our biggest event yet - a **Welcoming Refugees Community Service Fair** at Caroline Freeland Urban Park in Bethesda on Saturday, September 17. Over 100 people joined us to meet 10 organizations  active in welcoming refugees in our community - and for conversations with refugees and people who serve them. See [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/welcoming-refugees-community-service-fair-tickets-393998880257) for information about that great event, and we invite you to get involved!

**Spring 2023 Community Service Week Event.*** Building on the success of our Fall 2022 Community Service Fair, the Washington Center for International Education is partnering with co-sponsors including American University’s Immigration Lab to convene a public workshop on [The Health & Wellness of Afghan Newcomers]. This workshop aims to identify community resources and prepare a plan of action to overcome obstacles to well-being for the Afghan community. JOIN US for this meaningful discussion this May.
