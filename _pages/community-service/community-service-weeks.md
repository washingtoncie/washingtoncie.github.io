## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)**, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is happy to announce Community Service Weeks -- two weeks to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community -- April 23-30 and September 9-18, 2022. WCIE organizes community service programs in collaboration with **English Now!**, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland. English Now! will serve as the co-sponsor of Community Service Week.

WCIE and English Now! have organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2015. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area's international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Let’s think globally and serve & engage locally, together!**

This year’s Community Service Week activities will address three areas:

- helping neighbors in need through a [food and household goods drive](/community-service/household-goods-and-food-drive),
- [fighting racism](/community-service/walk-and-talk-against-racism), and
- [serving refugee families](/community-service/refugee-resettlement) as they arrive in the area,

But our Community Service Week Steering Committee team is considering these and other activities that respond to needs in the community and the unique challenges of the continuing pandemic. Watch here for more information about activities for Community Service Weeks, and we invite you to get involved!

**Partners.** WCIE and English Now! are pleased to serve the community through partnerships with great local organizations including MCAEL, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Homes Not Borders, Community Reach of Montgomery County, Identity, Inc., September House MAJ, THIS for Diplomats, the Connie Morella (Bethesda) Library, and more.
