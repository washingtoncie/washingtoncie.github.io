## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)**, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is happy to announce its Spring 2022 Community Service Week, to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community, September 9-20, 2022. WCIE organizes community service programs in collaboration with **English Now!**, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland. English Now! will serve as the co-sponsor of Community Service Week.

WCIE and English Now! have organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2015. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area's international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Let’s think globally and serve & engage locally, together!**

Our Spring 2022 Community Service Week offered many opportunities to get engaged. Click on the links below to learn about our program last Spring. This Fall, you will have opportunities to join all these same activities and more. In addition, activities will continue through the fall, with monthly activities ongoing in October and November. Links to sign up will be posted by mid-August. Bookmark this website – and we look forward to you joining us!

We are especially excited to extend an invitation to join us at a **Welcoming Refugees Community Service Fair at Caroline Freeland Urban Park, 7200 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814**, on Friday, September 17, 2:00-5:00pm. This event will be featured as part of [Welcoming Week](https://welcomingamerica.org/initiatives/welcoming-week), a nationwide initiative that encourages communities to be more welcoming -- and will encourage us all to <u>connect</u>, and not to focus on divisions. Montgomery County has declared itself a "welcoming county" as part of the "[Welcoming America](https://welcomingamerica.org/)" initiative, and we’re glad to be a part of the area’s welcoming efforts. Join us to think globally, serve locally, and build community!

Watch here for more information about activities for this and future Community Service Weeks, and we invite you to get involved!
