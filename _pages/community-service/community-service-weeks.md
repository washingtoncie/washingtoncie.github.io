## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)**, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is happy to announce its Fall 2022 Community Service Week, to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community, September 9-20, 2022. WCIE organizes community service programs in collaboration with **English Now!**, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland. English Now! will serve as the co-sponsor of Community Service Week.

WCIE and English Now! have organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2015. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area's international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Let’s think globally and serve & engage locally, together!**

Activities will start in September and continue through the fall, with monthly activities ongoing in October and November. Links to sign up will be posted by mid-August. Bookmark this website – and we look forward to you joining us for activities including the following:

- Saturday, September 10 - furnish an apartment for a newly-arrived refugee family;
- Thursday, September 15 - connect with residents of a senior living community for a gardening activity;
- Tuesday, September 20 - serve a meal to food insecure residents of the area; and
- help neighbors in need through a [household goods and furniture drive](https://washingtoncie.org/community-service/household-goods-and-food-drive).

Watch here for more information about activities for this and future Community Service Weeks, and we invite you to get involved!

In addition, we invite you to learn more about and [serve refugee families](https://washingtoncie.org/community-service/refugee-resettlement) as they arrive in the area. We are especially excited to extend an invitation to join us at a **Welcoming Refugees Community Service Fair at Caroline Freeland Urban Park, 7200 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814**, on Saturday, September 17, 2:00-5:00pm.
