## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

We have offered Community Service Weeks twice a year, in partnership with English Now!, since 2016. Community Service Weeks offer many options to participate in small group community service activities. Our Spring 2021 Community Service Week took place April 12-22; and our Fall 2021 Community Service Week will take place September 10-19.

We organize Community Service Week activities to connect the international and the local communities - and to inspire us all. In addition many activities are online so accessible to everyone, around the world. See the flyer from Spring 2021 for information about the kinds of programs we organize.

Activities focus on topics that many people in our school community care deeply about, such as helping neighbors in need with a food and household goods collection, fighting racism, supporting refugees in our local community, and taking action against climate change.

In Fall 2021, save the dates for a Community Service Fair & Ice Cream Social on Friday, September 17; and an International Walk & Talk Against Racism, on Saturday, September 18. Watch this space or [contact us](mailto:communityservice@washingtoncie.org) for more information or to get involved.

**Many, many thanks to the Community Service Week Steering Committee that helps us design and offer this program!** We are grateful to Marlene Da Vargem, Sally Dai, Anna Hauache, Michael Kranefeld, Wendy Morris, Kanako Nakai, Josie Stommel, and Efrem Tilahun for getting involved amidst a global pandemic in Spring 2021, and to Carmen Ayala, Linda Chang, Claudia Mansmann, and Sara Tadios, for getting involved in Fall 2021. Please let us know if youâ€™d be interested in getting involved in these kinds of activities in the future.
