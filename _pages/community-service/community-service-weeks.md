## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)**, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is happy to announce Community Service Weeks -- two weeks to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community -- April 25-May 7 and September 9-18, 2022. WCIE organizes community service programs in collaboration with **English Now!**, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland. English Now! will serve as the co-sponsor of Community Service Week.

WCIE and English Now! have organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2015. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area's international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Let’s think globally and serve & engage locally, together!**

Our Spring 2022 Community Service Week offers many opportunities to get engaged. Click on the links below to learn more and to register.
