Many Afghan newcomers have medical and mental health concerns that require immediate attention as well as long-term care far beyond their immediate settlement needs. Food insecurity because of unemployment, chronic health conditions, lack of access to healthcare, and mental health concerns arising from the traumas of the country’s collapse, uncertainty regarding friends and loved ones still in Afghanistan, and the pressures of resettlement all affect newcomers.

For new immigrants, accessing healthcare services has always been challenging because of cultural, linguistic and economic barriers – and the barriers to health and well-being are even greater for Afghan newcomers because of language and cultural barriers.
