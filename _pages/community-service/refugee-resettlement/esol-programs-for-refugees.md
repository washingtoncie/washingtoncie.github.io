title: ESOL Programs for Refugees

<section markdown="1">
WCIE’s English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs for refugees respond to a vital need, as English is crucial in transition to life in the U.S. and connects newcomers to their communities.

**PURPOSE:** Our programs are focused on two specific audiences:

- **EQUIPPING LEADERS.** We are serving 30 Afghan women judges who fled from Taliban rule. These remarkable women navigated their system to be leaders in their society. They can be leaders in ours. More information: see [here](/community-service/refugee-resettlement/esol-programs-for-refugees/iawj-judges).
- **CONNECTING.** We are serving Afghan women with young children in the home who would otherwise be cut off from their communities and dependent on others. We have started three of these classes and hope to launch more. More information: [see here](/community-service/refugee-resettlement/esol-programs-for-refugees/first-steps).

**IMPACT:** WCIE ESOL programs are offered online to small group classes of four students maximum. Teachers are professionals, very experienced, and compassionate. Classes are online because most students do not have transportation to permit them to attend classes in person, far smaller than most ESOL classes to ensure attention to individual needs of the students, and tailored to the very specific profiles of these groups of students. These programs afford recently-resettled refugees the personalized care they need.
