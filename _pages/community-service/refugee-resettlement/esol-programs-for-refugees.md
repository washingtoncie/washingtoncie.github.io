## ESOL Programs for Refugees

WCIE ESOL programs for refugees enroll students in small group classes. Classes are taught online, in recognition of our experience that transportation and logistical constraints make an online program more practical and more effective than in-person group classes.

WCIE sees a broad range of needs but is focusing on three ESOL programs for refugees:

### PROGRAM FOR WOMEN JUDGES FROM AFGHANISTAN

WCIE is working with the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ) on behalf of their Afghanistan chapter, to design and deliver an ESOL program to 30 female judges who are refugees. This program will serve 11 Afghani women jurists who are already in the U.S. and 19 who are overseas. Classes in this program will be taught in small groups of four students maximum, following the personalized model that we have seen work so well with other refugee audiences.

**Background**. Female judges made up about 10% of the sitting judges in Afghanistan. Contrary to what one might expect, they were often assigned the most difficult cases in the country–cases that involved corruption, terrorism, domestic violence, narcotics and
related matters.

Court cases were televised in Afghanistan. Many judges are known by name and appearance. Once the Taliban took power in August 2021, Afghanistan’s female judges immediately lost their jobs. They were threatened and went into hiding. Some, with the support of the IAWJ, fled the country.

**The program**. IAWJ has asked us to offer a program to 11 judges from their Afghanistan chapter who are already in the U.S. and 19 of whom are still overseas. IAWJ’s ultimate goal is to support the transition of these remarkable women to work in the United States, if possible in legal support related positions. Some may even eventually be sponsored for studies in LL.M. programs–but sustained English language studies come first for all of them.

**Support**. We invite you to support a program focusing on the needs of these students. Your support will enable us to offer small group classes to these 30 judges – including the 19 who are still overseas. 17 of the judges currently reside in a detention camp in Dubai known as “Humanitarian City” as of July 2022, but we understand that we can reach students there with a small group class model even before they arrive in the U.S.

**Our goal**: to help these remarkable women make progress in their English as they make their way to the U.S. and along each step of their resettlement experience, in a personalized class environment, with well-trained, experienced instructors. In addition, we intend to offer structured programming beyond their classes to encourage them and support their professional development. Join us to help make this happen.

### FIRST STEPS IN ENGLISH

WCIE and English Now! have been working with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to offer classes to refugees since Fall 2020. Based on our experience, First Steps in English has emerged as the program we’ve offered that has the most dramatic impact with the students it serves–and we’d like to offer it to more students.

**Background**. First Steps in English serves one of the most difficult refugee audiences to reach: mothers with young children in the home who would not otherwise have access to sustained, high-quality English language education. Students in this program are all from Afghanistan, where families are often large, and where women may or may not have achieved high levels of educational attainment. Now in the U.S., these young mothers are at a crucial point in their transition to life here. Our goal: to help them learn English, find community, and function outside their homes, to support them and their families’ resettlement experience.

**The program**. We have experimented with different academic models and now believe that we have one that predictably works for this hard-to-reach student population. Eight students are studying in this program in two groups of four, starting as complete beginners in English. This program meets twice a week for 90 minute class sessions. Class sizes are small, maximum four students, to ensure personalization of the class experience and an opportunity for each student to work on speaking.

WCIE’s model for this class is innovative. Students all meet 1:1 with an Academic Advisor as well as a Dari- and Pashto-speaking Student Advisor before joining the class, so that we can understand their level of English and confirm that they will be able to succeed in the class. Then, our Dari- and Pashto-speaking Student Advisor joins each of the first class sessions for the first 30 minutes of the class as an Assistant Teacher, to confirm students’ readiness to learn online and build community.

One group of four students has been studying twice per week since January of this year. They are making great progress! They have shown great improvement in their conversational English and have bonded as a class. This class is a wonderful opportunity for them to meet and build a sense of community while they develop their English skills.

In June of 2022, we started a second group of four students, also at the low beginner level. These students are already showing promising improvement and dedication to their English-learning goals.

**Support**. We invite you to [support](/support) our First Steps in English program. We know through our contacts with the IRC and others caring for refugees that the need for this type of program is dramatic. Most students with this profile have difficulty attending community-based ESOL programs because of family obligations, making the First Steps in English online program the best way they can avoid isolation in their new communities.

**Our goal**: to help these students make progress in their English as they continue through each step of their resettlement experience, in a personalized class environment, with well-trained, experienced instructors. We would like to go from two groups of four students to seven in Fall 2022–and to offer structured programming beyond their classes to encourage them and support their cultural transitions. Join us to help make this happen.

### JOB HUNTING IN ENGLISH

WCIE is offering one additional program–it is earlier stage, but may also merit further development. In May 2022, we started a class “Job Hunting in English”, specifically targeting the ongoing job hunting needs of refugees. We have completed a pilot offering of this class to three intermediate-level students, meeting once per week. This class has been offered in-person, but future offerings of this class will be in a hybrid model (mix of online and in-person), to overcome the transportation and other barriers many face to attending class in-person.

This class focuses on language for job-seeking, including relevant grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation development with a lot of speaking. Curriculum is [Cambridge English for Job Hunting](https://www.cambridge.es/en/catalogue/business-english/other-titles/cambridge-english-for/job-hunting). Topics have included current minimum wage rules in DC, MD, VA , including wages, salaries, overtime and tipped wages, public libraries and some of the free on-site and electronic services they offer, and job-interview skills. The class employs an active, hands-on workshop approach, with students bringing laptops and receiving help registering on online job search sites like Indeed.com, ZipRecruiter, and LinkedIn.

Many organizations and people supporting refugee resettlement provide job search support, but we believe that this class addresses a gap–but putting a trained ESOL professional in a position to help with the practical aspects of job searching, in a hands-on small group format.

WCIE thanks St. Columba's Episcopal Church for its support of the pilot offering of this class and is eager to partner with other organizations or donors for future offerings of these programs.
