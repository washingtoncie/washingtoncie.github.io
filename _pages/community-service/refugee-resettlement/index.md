Refugees are people whose lives have been upended by war, conflict and natural disasters. They are resettled around the world through a global effort coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in unusual circumstances such as the collapse of the government in Afghanistan in 2021 are evacuated then brought into the refugee resettlement system later.

**Think globally, serve locally.** Refugee resettlement is an issue that starts globally but requires communities to mobilize locally, to make resettlement work. This issue aligns with our mission and inspires many of our volunteers. Join us to help make refugee resettlement successful in the Washington, D.C. area.

### Community Learning

The Washington, D.C. area is a popular destination for many refugees because of the connection that some refugees have with the federal government, family ties, and a strong labor market generally. WCIE organizes community learning events to help like-minded people and organizations understand how to resettle refugees well, in this area.

Our most recent community learning program was an event, “Welcoming Refugees from Afghanistan & Ukraine,” at the Connie Morella (Bethesda) Library on May 9, soon after our Spring 2022 Community Service Week. We are grateful to our speakers, Mikhail Basyuk, who shared a Ukrainian-Russian’s perspective–a personal story of coming to the U.S.; and Sarwar Azizi, who served as a senior official in Afghanistan’s Central Bank and Ministry of Education and previously with the United Nations, and who spoke about his family’s experience as well as how we can understand the needs of Afghan evacuees settling in the area and around the country. We also heard from Kyle Monsees, the International Rescue Committee (IRC)’s Volunteer & Family Mentor Coordinator, about how people can get involved locally in the important work of refugee resettlement.

You can see information about this public program [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/welcoming-refugees-from-afghanistan-ukraine-registration-313660927277). Please [email us](mailto:communityservice@washingtoncie.org) for information about future programs–starting with our **Welcoming Refugees Community Service Fair at Caroline Freeland Urban Park, 7200 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814**, on Friday, September 17, 2:00-5:00pm. This event will bring together eight to 10 organizations and feature a storytelling program where we can hear the stories of refugees – both recently resettled and here for some time – as we come together to consider thinking globally, serving locally, and getting involved in these issues in our community.

### Support for IRC Programs

Our efforts in this area start with partnerships. We are delighted to support the efforts of the [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/) (IRC), headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, to resettle refugees in the Washington, D.C. area. We organize groups that participate in the IRC’s [Welcome Home](https://www.rescue.org/volunteer/refugee-welcome-home-project-volunteer) program to furnish apartments for newly-arrived refugee families and also work with another local organization, [Homes Not Borders](https://www.homesnotborders.org/), to furnish apartments. See [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/englishnow/sets/72157720038146891/) for photos from a volunteer effort that furnished three apartments in October 2021. In addition, we encourage people to get involved in IRC family mentoring and other programs. Participate in one of [the IRC’s monthly webinars](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmJUvE_Pa7ZjZI5R6ATvLj9XnXKvRB6U889IdIMWyFjYN5kg/viewform) to learn more about their programs.

### ESOL Studies

WCIE has been sponsoring enrollments of recently-resettled refugees in our partner English Now!’s English classes since Fall 2020. English language studies are important to refugees’ transition to life in the U.S. [English Now!](http://english-now.com)’s group classes are small–six students maximum in-person, four students maximum online–and taught by experienced professionals, making them an unusually personalized way to care for refugees.

We see a dramatic need for English language learning support on the part of Afghan evacuees as well as other IRC clients – and an opportunity to deliver programs targeting specific audiences that are not reached by other providers. With that, WCIE is now offering classes that target specific audiences that are not reached by other providers.

See [here](/community-service/refugee-resettlement/esol-programs-for-refugees) for information about WCIE’s ESOL programs for refugees and how to support this effort.

### Student Service Learning

Finally, we are inspired by our work with high school students, and we hope that students find inspiration in our programs as well. Youth learn about issues related to refugee resettlement in our Student Service Learning Program, [Youth Facing the Global Refugee & Migration Crisis](/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis), which includes participation in a diplomacy simulation offered at the U.S. Department of State.
