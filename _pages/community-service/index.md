## Community Service Programs: Connecting the Washington, D.C.-Area International and Local Communities
WCIE community service programs are organized in collaboration with English Now!, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland.

Since 2015, English Now! students and staff have engaged in community service activities with area non-profit organizations including: The Children’s Inn at the the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Cares, Bethesda Sunrise Senior Living, and the Betty Ann Krahnke Center. In addition, volunteers have helped welcome newly arrived families when they enroll their children in Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) at the [Rocking Horse Road International Admissions and Enrollment Center](https://montgomerycountymd.galaxydigital.com/need/detail/?need_id=434317). Community service programs are offered in [Community Service Weeks](/community-service/community-service-weeks) that take place twice-yearly, and some community service opportunities are available year-round.

Since 2018, WCIE and English Now!, together with the [Montgomery Coalition for Adult English Literacy (MCAEL)](http://mcael.org/), have participated in [Welcoming Week](http://welcomingweek.org/), an effort to welcome immigrants and refugees in communities throughout the United States.

In 2019, WCIE and English Now! participated in a MCAEL project to create symbols of welcoming throughout Montgomery County, Maryland, by creating and decorating a door that expresses a welcoming spirit. Students and staff, along with residents of Bethesda Sunrise Senior Living, painted a door with colorful leaves representing our thriving community of diverse cultures. The door was displayed first at the Connie Morella (Bethesda) Public Library, and now resides at the MCPS International Admissions and Enrollment Center at Rocking Horse Road.

In 2020, during the global pandemic, WCIE and English Now! offered Exploring English Together, Online! classes to over 100 children in the community as a community service effort to support international families. In addition, we organized food drives to support Bethesda Cares, NIH Children’s Inn, and September House MAJ, and organized programs on well-being including Saturday open discussions about well-being as well as enrollments in a popular Coursera course on the topic, tuition free!
